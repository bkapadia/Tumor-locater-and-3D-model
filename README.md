# Tumor-locater-and-3D-model
It is a complicated and sensitive task for radiologists to locate and diagnose diseases in patients. Medical practitioners are required to analyze scans for multiple patients with varying degree of difficulty. Creating an image analysis application can ease the process of disease identification for radiologists. Therefore, this project dealt with providing a software to visualize tumors of different sizes and shapes. The simple to use software takes unaltered CT scan images and will process, segment the images and finally output a 3D model of the tumor. The project was completed successfully; however, issues such as outliers in 3D generation and slow speed of the application were found. Further fine-tuning of the software can allow for the application to be more useful in actual medical situations.
